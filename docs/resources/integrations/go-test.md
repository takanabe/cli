# Go Test

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a reference page. See [Getting started](../../getting-started/), [Sending data to Launchable](../../sending-data-to-launchable/), and [Subsetting your test runs](../../actions/subsetting-your-test-runs.md) for more comprehensive usage guidelines.
{% endhint %}

## Recording test results

After running tests, point the CLI to your test report files to collect test results and train the model:

```bash
# install JUnit report formatter
go get -u github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report

# run the tests however you normally do, then produce a JUnit XML file
go test -v ./... | go-junit-report > report.xml

launchable record tests --build <BUILD NAME> go-test .
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
You might need to take extra steps to make sure that `launchable record tests` always runs even if the build fails. See [Always record tests](../../sending-data-to-launchable/ensuring-record-tests-always-runs.md).
{% endhint %}

## Subsetting your test runs

The high level flow for subsetting is:

1. Get the full list of tests/test paths and pass that to `launchable subset` with an optimization target for the subset
2. `launchable subset` will get a subset from the Launchable platform and output that list to a text file
3. Pass the text file into your test runner to run only those tests

To retrieve a subset of tests, first list all the tests you would normally run and pass that to `launchable subset`:

```bash
go test -list . ./... | launchable subset \
  --build <BUILD NAME> \
  --confidence <TARGET> \
  go-test > launchable-subset.txt
```

* The `--build` should use the same `<BUILD NAME>` value that you used before in `launchable record build`.
* The `--confidence` option should be a percentage; we suggest `90%` to start. You can also use `--time` or `--target`; see [Subsetting your test runs](../../actions/subsetting-your-test-runs.md) for more info.

This creates a file called `launchable-subset.txt` that you can pass into your command to run tests:

```bash
go test -run $(cat launchable-subset.txt) ./... -v 2>&1 | go-junit-report > report.xml
```
